    <p>2048 Puzzle Game: A Modern Web Experience
        The 2048 Puzzle Game is a popular single-player sliding tile game where players combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to create a tile with the number 2048. Below is a detailed description of the game, its working, and all the features that can be implemented to deliver a modern, engaging experience.
        
        Game Objective
        The player’s goal is to slide numbered tiles on the grid, combining them into higher values by matching tiles of the same number. The ultimate aim is to reach the 2048 tile, but the game doesn’t end there. Players can continue playing to achieve even higher scores.
        
        Core Gameplay
        Grid Layout:
        
        A 4x4 grid serves as the playing area.
        At the start of the game, two tiles (either 2 or 4) appear randomly.
        Tile Movement:
        
        Tiles can be moved in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
        When two tiles of the same number collide during a move, they merge into a new tile with the sum of their values (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
        Game Over:
        
        The game ends when there are no valid moves left (i.e., the grid is full and no tiles can merge).
        Scoring:
        
        Every time tiles merge, the value of the new tile is added to the player’s score.
        The score keeps updating dynamically.
        Modern Features to Include
        1. Home Screen (Menu)

        3. Animations
        Tiles should slide smoothly across the grid with a bounce effect upon merging.
        Add animations for:
        New tiles appearing (e.g., scaling in from 0 to full size).
        Merged tiles glowing briefly to highlight the action.

        6. Responsiveness

        Track statistics like:
        High score.
        Total games played.
        Average score.
        Include a nickname feature to personalize the leaderboard.

        Timed Mode: The player has a limited time to score as much as possible.
        Challenge Mode: Customizable grid sizes (e.g., 3x3, 5x5) or additional obstacles.
        9. Visual Effects
        Subtle effects like glowing tiles, particle bursts when tiles merge, and grid shake when no moves are possible.
        Use CSS transitions for smooth, modern animations.
        10. Pause and Resume
        Allow players to pause the game and resume later.
        Save the current game state locally so players can pick up where they left off.

        Web Game Workflow
        Initialization:
        
        The grid initializes with two random tiles (2 or 4).
        The score is set to 0.
        User Input:
        
        Players can move tiles using arrow keys, W/A/S/D, or swipe gestures.
        Input triggers JavaScript functions to calculate tile movement.
        Tile Movement:
        
        Tiles slide in the chosen direction until they collide with another tile or the edge.
        If two tiles of the same value collide, they merge, forming a new tile.
        New Tile Generation:
        
        After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears randomly on an empty space.
        Game Over Check:
